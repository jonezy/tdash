# swig + express = sexpress

### What is sexpress?

sexpress is a starting point for building node apps using the swig
templating engine (my personal favourite).

It comes with the following stuff

- Node.js + Express
- Grunt based build system
- Swig Templating Engine
- Twitter Bootstrap
- 1140px Grid System

### What is it good for?
- Internal projects
- Prototyping ideas

### Getting Started

- Clone or fork the repository (i would recommend forking)
- git clone git@github.com/yourusername/sexpress.git ./project-name
- cd project-name && rm -rf .git
- npm install
- install grunt npm install -g grunt
- run 'grunt'
- ...
- now you can start your project
